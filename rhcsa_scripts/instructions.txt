### RHCSA Review Instructions ###
- Reset desktop and server
- Make sure to run lab nfsmount setup on serverX
- The root and student passwords need to be recovered and set to their default values (redhat & student, respectively)
- The desktop machine needs to operate in graphical mode. This change must persist through reboots.
- SELinux must be enabled and enforcing.
- Configure the system so all files created by root will have read and write permissions for the owner and group by default. Make sure this change is persistent.
- Ensure that yum is functioning properly.
- Configure your system for authentication via LDAP and Kerberos. The settings are as follow:
  * LDAP should be secured with TLS.
  * A CA cert for TLS is located at: http://classroom.example.com/pub/example-ca.crt
  * LDAP server: classroom.example.com
  * Base DN: dc=example,dc=com
  * Kerberos Realm: example.com
  * KDC/Kerberos admin: classroom.example.com
  * Home directories should be created on login
  * A repo can be located at: http://content.example.com/rhel7.0/x86_64/dvd
- Confirm that SSH is functioning properly and starts at boot.
- Create a new user named "mhill" with the following criteria:
  * This user's password must expire in 65 days.
  * This user must have a comment of "lol champagne" set
- Create a new system user named "meme_bot" - this user should not have a login shell.
- The directory /dank_memes is currently set to default permissions after creation. Configure it in the following manner:
  * The user ownership should be "root", group ownership should be "lol"
  * All files created inside the directory should be automatically owned by the group.
  * The "moderators" group will also need read and write access to this directory, as well as all files created inside this directory.
  * The "meme-bot" user should have read access to all files created inside of this directory.
  * Any user not explicitly named above should not be able to access this directory.
  - Create two MBR partitions on on /dev/vdb of 1GB each.
  - Using /dev/vdb's partitions, create a volume group called rhcsa with an extent size of 1MB.
  - Create a logical volume of exactly 1337 extents and persistently mount this device to /content. Use a filesystem of your choice.
  - Create a cron job to echo "hello" to a text file located at /root/hi.txt that executes every half hour.
  - serverX is exporting shares at /nfs/{1..5}. Configure your desktop to mount them with the following criteria:
    * Use autofs indirect mounting to mount all 5 directories on demand
    * A wildcard should be used in the mapping files
    * Kerberos authentication and full encryption should be used on all connections
      * Keytab: http://classroom.example.com/pub/keytabs/desktopX.keytab
- Ensure that port 443 is open for the TCP protocol in the default zone
- Ensure that journald logs persist after rebooting the server.
- Configure a static network connection for eth0 named "test-eth0" using nmcli with the following criteria:
 * IP: 172.25.X.10/24
 * GW: 172.25.X.254
 * DNS: 172.25.254.254
 * This connection should be active and start on boot.
- Ensure desktop is able to sync time from classroom.example.com.
